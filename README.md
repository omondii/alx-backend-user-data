<b> Logging refers to tracking of events as a software runs. 
    Messages are logged to a file </b>
Logging Levels:
1. debug - Detailed information, mostly used when diagnosing problems
2. Info - Confirmation that things are working as expected
3. Warning - Often indicates occurrence of a problem or an impending problem. Software still works as expected /* Default logging mode */
4. Error - A serious problem occured hence software didn't perform some function 
5. Critical - A serious error, indicating the program itself maybe unable to continue running
